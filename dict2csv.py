Well I did a search and did find a way to do it that works on the i730. It was buried and the information is something I have placed in the back of the brain for quite some time. Here are the steps.1. Create a new text message.2. Put \"6245\" without the quotes in the To: box.3. Leave the Subject line blank4. Put e-mail address as the first thing in the message portion, followed by a space and then your message.5. Click send. You are still limited by 160 total characters including the e-mail address, so this would only be for SHORT e-mails.Other nice thing is you don't have to log into your e-mail account or use data to send, but this does cost you a TXT message, so you might be paying $0.10 if you don't have txt messaging added.Also the message comes through as 8125555555@vtext.com (where the beginning is your number), or as your vtext.com name if you registered one when setting up a vtext.com account, so keep that in mind.", "caller": "", "call_type": ""}, {"datetime": "29 Mar 2008", "content": "settle down nora, I got a message today from \"6245\" that was totally random and made no sense to me. \u00a0And two days ago I got a text from Telus saying I owed them for a bill.
